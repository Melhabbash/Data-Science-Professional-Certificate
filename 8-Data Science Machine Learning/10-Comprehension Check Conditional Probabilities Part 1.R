
# Q1
# In a previous module, we covered Bayes theorem and the Bayesian paradigm. Conditional 
# probabilities are a fundamental part of this previous covered rule.
                  # P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)


# We first review a simple 
# example to go over conditional probabilities.
# Assume a patient comes into the doctor's office to test whether they have a particular disease.
  # The test is positive 85% of the time when tested on a patient with the disease 
  # (high sensitivity): P(test+ | disease)=0.85
  # The test is negative 90% of the time when tested on a healthy patient 
  # (high specificity):  P(test+ | health)=0.90
  # The disease is prevalent in about 2% of the community:  P(disease)=0.02

# Using Bayes theorem, calculate the probability that you have the disease if the test is positive.

# P(disease|test+) = P(test+|disease)*( P(disease)/P(test+) )
# = (P(test+|disease)P(disease))/ (P(test+|disease)P(disease) | P(test+|healthy)P(healthy))
# = (0.85x0.02)/(0.85x0.02+0.1x0.98) = 0.1478261

#0.148

# The following 4 questions (Q2-Q5) all relate to implementing this calculation using R.
# We have a hypothetical population of 1 million individuals with the following conditional 
# probabilities as described below:
# The test is positive 85% of the time when tested on a patient with the disease 
# (high sensitivity): 
# The test is negative 90% of the time when tested on a healthy patient (high specificity): 
# The disease is prevalent in about 2% of the community: 
# Here is some sample code to get you started:

set.seed(1)
disease <- sample(c(0,1), size=1e6, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.98,0.02))
disease
test <- rep(NA, 1e6)
test[disease==0] <- sample(c(0,1), size=sum(disease==0), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.90,0.10))
test[disease==1] <- sample(c(0,1), size=sum(disease==1), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.15, 0.85))

# Q2
# What is the probability that a test is positive?

#                test

mean(test) 
#0.114509

# Explanation
# The probability of a positive test can be calculated using mean(test).

# Q3
# What is the probability that an individual has the disease if the test is negative?

3065/1000000
#0.003065
mean(disease[test==0])

# Explanation
# The probability of having the disease given a negative test can be calculated 
# using mean(disease[test==0]).

# Q4
# What is the probability that you have the disease if the test is positive?

mean(disease[test==1]==1) 
#0.1471762

# Explanation
# The probability of having the disease given a positive test can be calculated 
# using mean(disease[test==1]==1).

# Q5
# If the test is positive, what is the relative risk of having the disease?

mean(disease[test==1]==1)/2*100 
#7.35881

# Explanation
# The increase in risk can be calculated using mean(disease[test==1]==1)/mean(disease==1).
