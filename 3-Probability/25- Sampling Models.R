# Monte Carlo simulation: Chance of casino losing money on roulette
# We build a sampling model for the random variable  S  that represents the casino's 
# total winnings. 

# sampling model 1: define urn, then sample
color <- rep(c("Black", "Red", "Green"), c(18, 18, 2)) # define the urn for the sampling 
# model
n <- 1000
X <- sample(ifelse(color == "Red", -1, 1), n, replace = TRUE)
X[1:10]

# sampling model 2: define urn inside sample function by noting probabilities
x <- sample(c(-1, 1), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(9/19, 10/19))    # 1000 independent draws
S <- sum(x)    # total winnings = sum of draws
