# We are now ready to put everything we've done so far together and wrangle our reported heights 
# data as we try to recover as many heights as possible. The code is complex but we will break it 
# down into parts.
# We start by cleaning up the height column so that the heights are closer to a feet'inches format. 
# We added an original heights column so we can compare before and after.
# Let's start by writing a function that cleans up strings so that all the feet and inches formats
# use the same x'y format when appropriate.
